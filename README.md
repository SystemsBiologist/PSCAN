In case the user would like to run the notebook using Jupyter, this code should be run first:
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("pheatmap","MASS","cluster","mclust","flexmix","lattice","fpc",
                "amap", "RColorBrewer","locfit","TSCAN","genefilter","statmod",
                "ggplot2","gplots","DESeq2","matrixStats","robustbase","philentropy",
                "igraph","boot","biomaRt","tidyr","calibrate","partykit","RWeka",
                "rpart","rpart.plot","imager","png","NetIndices","httr","jsonlite","tidyverse",
                "samr","tidyverse"))
